# Install R and RStudio Desktop

## R

* Go to https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html and select a mirror site closest to you. 
  * Scroll down to the USA section.
  * I usually select the Washington or Oregon option. (Close to Utah.)
* After you select a mirror site, you should be taken to https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/
* Download the correct version of R for your computer operating system and run the installer.
* After you're finished installing R, follow the instructions below to install RStudio.

## RStudio Desktop

* Go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
* Download the correct version of RStudio Desktop for your operating system and run the installer.
* Post a screenshot on the discussion board or come to office hours if you run into problems.

## Turn in Assignment

* Turn in a screenshot of RStudio once you have it installed on your computer.
