# Install R and RStudio Desktop

A video demonstration of installing R and RStudio on a computer running Windows 10 is available at: https://youtu.be/VLzhzU8SQQA

## R

* Go to https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html and select a mirror site closest to you. 
  * Scroll down to the USA section.
  * I usually select the Washington or Oregon option. (Close to Utah.)
* After you select a mirror site, you should be taken to https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/
* Download the correct version of R for your computer operating system and run the installer.
* After you're finished installing R, follow the instructions below to install RStudio.

## RStudio Desktop

* Go to https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download
* Download the correct version of RStudio Desktop for your operating system and run the installer.
* Post a screenshot on the discussion board or come to office hours if you run into problems.

## RTools (2023 notes)

* I've seen some errors connected to installing packages in RStudio. A warning popped up about needing to install RTools. I needed to intall RTools from https://cran.rstudio.com/bin/windows/Rtools/ (I had to select the version that matched my version of R - 4.2.2 as of 01/23/2023.) I'm making a note here in case this is seen by more individuals so we have a note of it for next year.

## Turn in Assignment

* Turn in a screenshot of RStudio once you have it installed on your computer.
